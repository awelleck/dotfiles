# dotfiles

Dotfiles on Unix/Linux are hidden configuration files. My goal is to consolidate and backup any configs I adopt and use GitHub as a way to sync them. I generally don't prefer a ton of customization and like to understand all configurations I enable. As I find additional configurations I will add them to this repository.

## TODO
* Create an instalation script
* Add .bashrc, .alias files
